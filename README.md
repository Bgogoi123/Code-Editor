# Code Editor
> This is a code editor that includes a file tree.  It has the ability to create files and directories. 
> A directory can also include nested files and folders. 
> I used 'code mirror' for the editor, which allows writing code with syntax highlighting enabled. Modifications can be made to a specific file and can be saved, which will be retained for the duration of the application's runtime. 
> There is also a delete option to erase the file.
